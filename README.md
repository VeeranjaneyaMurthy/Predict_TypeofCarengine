# Predicting Type Of Car Engine
#Problem Statement: Predicting Type Of Car Engine

#Inspiration To explore this type of models and learn more about the subject.

#Technologies Used:R

#Work done: 
>Data is analysed and processed already using excel,Feature engineering is also done. ->Data Aquisition ->Divided the dataset into training data and test data. ->Exploratory Analysis -Univariate Analysis -Multivariate Analysis -Variance Inflation Factor: Vif, It Measure increase in variance, 1 means no correlation ->Model building using Linear Regression algorithm. ->Optimize Model ->Model Validation ->Prediction
